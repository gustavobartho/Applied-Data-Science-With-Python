## Module 1 - Introduction to Data Science in Python

This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.

#### This Module main goal are:

* Understand techniques such as lambdas and manipulating csv files;
* Describe common Python functionality and features used for data science;
* Query DataFrame structures for cleaning and processing;
* Explain distributions, sampling, and t-tests;

### Week 1 - Fundamentals of Data Manipulation with Python

In this week you'll get an introduction to the field of data science, review common Python functionality and features which data scientists use, and be introduced to the Coursera Jupyter Notebook for the lectures. All of the course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus, and you can find more information about the Jupyter Notebooks on our Course Resources page.

#### Week learning objectives:

* Load, manipulate, and select data using numpy, as well as understand the fundamental data types in the numpy ecosystem;
* Show the benefits of vectorization with numpy data;
* Apply regular expressions to string data;
* Demonstrate, at a high level, how regular expression pattern matching is expressed;

### Week 2 - Basic Data Processing with Pandas

In this week of the course you'll learn the fundamentals of one of the most important toolkits Python has for data cleaning and processing -- pandas. You'll learn how to read in data into DataFrame structures, how to query these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed. 

#### Week learning objectives:

* Demonstrate how the series class builds on top of numpy datatypes;
* Remember that the series class is a numpy array;
* Demonstrate the basics of how to query a series structure;
* Remember the dataframe as the principle data science structure;
* Define the various features of a dataframe;
* Demonstrate what an axis is in relation to dataframes;
* Demonstrate the difference between the series and dataframe classes;
* Create and use pandas DataFrames to represent raw data;

### Week 3 - More Data Processing with Pandas

In this week you'll deepen your understanding of the python pandas library by learning how to merge DataFrames, generate summary tables, group data into logical pieces, and manipulate dates. We'll also refresh your understanding of scales of data, and discuss issues with creating metrics for analysis. The week ends with a more significant programming assignment.

#### Week learning objectives:

* Create and use pandas DataFrames to represent raw data;

### Week 4 - Answering Questions with Messy Data

In this week of the course you'll be introduced to a variety of statistical techniques such a distributions, sampling and t-tests. The week ends with two discussions of science and the rise of the fourth paradigm -- data driven discovery.

#### Week learning objectives:

* Demonstrate basic statistical test knowledge on dataframes in pandas;
* Recognize other kinds of structured data such as networks, graphs, natural language;

## Module 2 - Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

This course will introduce the learner to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. The course will start with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. The second week will focus on the technology used to make visualizations in python, matplotlib, and introduce users to best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework. The third week will be a tutorial of functionality available in matplotlib, and demonstrate a variety of basic statistical charts helping learners to identify when a particular method is good for a particular problem. The course will end with a discussion of other forms of structuring and visualizing data. 

#### This Module main goal are:

* Describe what makes a good or bad visualization;
* Understand best practices for creating basic charts;
* Identify the functions that are best for particular problems;
* Create a visualization using matplotlib;

### Week 1 - Principles of Information Visualization

In this module, you will get an introduction to principles of information visualization. We will be introduced to tools for thinking about design and graphical heuristics for thinking about creating effective visualizations. All of the course information on grading, prerequisites, and expectations are on the course syllabus, which is included in this module. 

#### Week learning objectives:

* Choose a graphic that displays misleading information;
* Interpret the features of the graphic in order to identify the mechanism(s) that is/are used by the "encoder" to mislead the "decoder";
* Analyze the graphic and use principles from Alberto Cairo's work to explain how the graphic is misleading;
* Create a radar plot in order to reflect on the complexity of the misleading graphic;

### Week 2 - Basic Charting

In this module, you will delve into basic charting. For this week’s assignment, you will work with real world CSV weather data. You will manipulate the data to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates and demonstrate that you know how to create a line graph using matplotlib. Additionally, you will demonstrate the procedure of composite charts, by overlaying a scatter plot of record breaking data for a given year.

#### Week learning objectives:

* Work with real world CSV data;
* Know how to create a line graph using matplotlib;
* Manipulate data to get the minimum and maximum temperature;
* Demonstrate procedure of composite charts;

### Week 3 - Charting Fundamentals

In this module you will explore charting fundamentals. For this week’s assignment you will work to implement a new visualization technique based on academic research. This assignment is flexible and you can address it using a variety of difficulties - from an easy static image to an interactive chart where users can set ranges of values to be used.

#### Week learning objectives:

* Build more complex features using base features (i.e., artists);
* Create new ways of visualizing the data by expanding the matplotlib codebase;
* Use subplots to combine plots into a single figure;
* *eate insightful plots such as histograms, box plots, and histograms;
* Create animated and interactive visualizations;

### Week 4 - Charting Fundamentals

In this module, then everything starts to come together. Your final assignment is entitled “Becoming a Data Scientist.” This assignment requires that you identify at least two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension. You will state a research question that can be answered using these data sets and then create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question. You will then be asked to justify how your visual addresses your research question.

#### Week learning objectives:

* Identify two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension;
* State a research question that can be answered using two publicly accessible datasets;
* Create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question;
* Justify how the visual addresses your research question;
